            Welcome to ValidMe, a mobile application dedicated to user identity
            validation. At ValidMe, we are committed to the protection of your
            privacy and personal data. This privacy policy explains how we
            collect, use, and protect your information.


        </p>

        <h3>Information We Collect

        </h3>
        <p class="mb-5">ValidMe uses the camera of your device exclusively for
            the purpose of
            identity validation. We do not request, collect, or store your
            location or any other sensitive information that is not strictly
            necessary for identity validation.

        </p>
        <h3>Use of Cryptographic Keys


        </h3>
        <p>To ensure the security and privacy of your identity:

        </p>
        <ul class="mb-5">
            <li> We generate cryptographic keys (public and private keys)
                directly on your device.

            </li>
            <li>The private key is generated and stored only on your device and
                is never shared or transmitted outside of it.

            </li>
            <li>We do not keep copies or records of your private key.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Personal Data Processing

        </h3>
        <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>We do not make copies or store personal user information outside
                the device.
            </li>
            <li>We only use the data necessary for identity validation, and this
                data is processed exclusively for that purpose.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties

        </h3>
        <p class="mb-5">We do not share any personal information with third
            parties, except
            as strictly necessary to comply with applicable laws or the
            requirements of competent authorities.

        </p>

        <h3>GDPR Compliance

        </h3>

        <p class="mb-5">We comply with the General Data Protection Regulation
            (GDPR) of the
            European Union. This includes ensuring your rights such as access to
            your personal data, its rectification, deletion, and the portability
            of the same.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy

        </h3>
        <p class="mb-5">We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy. Any
            changes will
            be communicated promptly through the application or by email.
